moodle-availability_coursecompleted
==============================================
Restrict module and section access based on course completion.

This availability condition makes it easy to show modules or sections only when a user
completed a course. A course certificate is a good sample, but it can also be used to close
discussion forums, hide quizes or exams when a user finished a course.

Check the global documentation about availability conditions : https://docs.moodle.org/en/Conditional_activities_settings

Installation:

 1. Unpack the zip file into the availability/condition/ directory. A new directory will be created called coursecompleted.
 2. Go to Site administration > Notifications to complete the plugin installation.
